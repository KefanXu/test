		<div>The scope of our project was to provide deliverables and recommendations based on research that would help form the basis for a method of evaluating the strength of a relationship between a mentee and a mentor, and prototype some interactions/screens of a networking web platform based on the needs and pain points of people in the medical field.
</div>
		<div>The questionnaires focused on students in the medical fields, the graph shows their fields.
</div>
		<div>With our research findings and personas in mind, four people on the team brainstormed solutions together. We came up with as many ideas as possible without considering feasibility at this stage.Potential Features Brainstormed:MessagingPublic ProfileBioStrength/skills endorsed by othersGraph buttonCommentsResearch interestsPublicationsArea of studyAdd mentors/menteesIf not in the platform yet, can still add via email (invite)Current projectInstitution/affiliationMy Mentor's ProfileMentor Profile Recommendations based on users' info (index page)Update my profileSearch mentorsadvanced filters -location / institution / area of study SettingsPassword, email, notifications, privacy settings, log outGraph of connectionsHighlighted route between you and person whose graph you are viewingPop up window when you click a dot, go to their profileNotificationWelcome screen (button for login and signup) Login screenSignup screens Email/text verification “Please check your email and click the link, or input the code you received here”“Congratulations, you have successfully created an account.

		<div>Project Scope
</div>
		<div>85.7% (50% of students think it’s very important) of the students who took the survey think it’s important for people in their field to have strong mentorship with renowned mentors. All the participants in this survey have experience of receiving mentorship. Most of them have two mentors over the years in their field of study. 
Our survey also shows that contacting with the mentor personally is the most common way for students to find their mentors (57.1% of students would make contact with their mentors personally and 35.7% of students have their programs assigned mentors for them). When they are communicating with their mentors, most of the students would like to have a face-to-face meeting (85.7%) or send emails (64.3%).

We find that students in their field rarely use online-platforms to connect with their mentors. Though there are some networking platform, like Linkedin, 71.4% of the students have never used such a website to connect with their mentors. None of them use web platform to communicate with their mentor.

		<div>Since the primary users of this project will be students from medical school, we tried to collect data from students in the relevant fields. In those responses, most of the students are from medical fields such as Medicinal Chemistry and neurosurgery, though there is one student majoring in Education.

		<div>It is important for mentors and mentees in the medical field to be able to show off their mentorship connection to others. To address this problem, we created a prototype for a mobile app that would allow people to see mentorship connections on a graph. We also conducted some research into how to create a quanti- fiable score for a mentorship connection so that hiring organizations would be able to make use of this in their decision-making process. </div>

</div>
		<div>Due to the fact that we received both positive and negative feedback on having a scoring system quantifying the mentorship contributions of an individual, we decided to do two versions when creating prototypes, one with a scoring system - version 1, and one without - version 2. Version 1:When you first sign up, we would prompt to ask you whether you authorize our app to access your Phone and Email. Once your email and phone number are connected to our mobile app, we would run those data on the backend. We calculate the Mscore based on the interactions your mentor has with you (using the calculation method outlined in Dom et al). Through this version, a mentor is able to be assigned to a Mscore automatically.Version 1 is likely to have certain limitations due to current privacy laws. We strongly suggest that more review on privacy law needs to be done before deciding how the Mscore will be collected and calculated. We designed version 2 as a plan B - in case the privacy law forbids we collect user data, store them and use them for calculating Mscores. Version 2:In the notification center, for each mentor,  a notification pops up monthly to ask you to fill out a questionnaire. In the questionnaire, we ask you questions (question design would be based on the calculation method outlined in Dom et al) about the mentor from an objective perspective. We then use the information you provide to calculate the Mscore. Users would manually input this information that we otherwise need to collect through storing user data at the backend (demonstrated in version 1). In this way, we are able to avoid infringing data privacy.

</div>
		<div>The scoring system has some potential problems, including:May cause clustering that all mentees go to the mentor with higher score Makes people feel degrading Hard to be quantified</div>
		<div>A Closer Look at our Design
</div>
		<div>User Personas
</div>
		<div>Several advice from interviewees are quite useful:Generate card to put on their personal website Add tag system to show their strength (similar to linkedin)Write comments for the mentorship A quick visual guide / Strength graph to see what this person is likeCertificate is a good idea</div>
		<div>Prototyping
</div>
		<div>Link to the design:The scoring system might need to be redesigned to meet students’ concerns.Students think the graph feedback (the mentorship tree / connection) is useful for them to know other’s connection.Considering add a tag function Considering add card generating functionConsidering add strength graph Comment function could be usefulDo not ask for too much information from usersLet users to choose their interest area when they registers</div>
